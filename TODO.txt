[DONE] indicates the bot is currently supported.
>[WIP] indicates the bot is being actively worked on.
*[NXT] indicates the bot is to be added. Asterisk can be:
    ^ being worked on, but not actively, so it's not coming anytime soon
    + likely to be worked on at some point
    ? wanted to implement, but viability is not fully investigated
    - unlikely to be implemented, but noted here as a known and not-yet-discarded leveling bot
[CANT] indicates the bot has been discarded due to it being impossible (or too hard) to import, not just by lack of publicly documented API but by failure to reverse engineer it as well
